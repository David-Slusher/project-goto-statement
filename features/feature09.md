# Modify the current GUI program to use the web service as the word source.

The program should take an integer as a single command-line argument, 
representing the number of anagrams the chosen starting word should have
(the "difficulty" for this game). The difficulty is then sent to a server
that responds with the target word and its anagrams. All behavior of the main
program and GUI should be the same as before.
